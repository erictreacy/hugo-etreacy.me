# ⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

This `public/` directory contains automatically generated files from Hugo. Any changes made here will be overwritten the next time Hugo builds the site.

Instead, modify the source files in:
- `content/` for Markdown content
- `layouts/` for HTML templates
- `assets/` for CSS and other assets
- `static/` for static files

The files in this directory are generated when running:
```
hugo
```
or when running the development server:
```
hugo server
```
