<p>It has been years since I have taken to art. Sure, there is writing and music, both of which I take frequent moments to practice and enjoy, but drawing and painting haven&rsquo;t been my go-to choice for some time. I&rsquo;ve mostly converted to writing CSS. But these days, however, I have found my love for tangible art again. I can&rsquo;t take all the credit for my rekindling, it&rsquo;s mostly due to my children&rsquo;s affinity to it. At least once a day we sit and draw, doodle, paint, etc. My oldest son (6 yo) can tell when I get a little stressed because he will say to me, &ldquo;Art-it-out, dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I needed more supplies though. With that comes a choice â€” many choices. Where did I land? For sketch and prototype drawings I use a good ol&rsquo; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ticonderoga-Tri-Conderoga-Pencils-Black-22500/dp/B001TQFX3I?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Graphite #2 HB Soft pencil by Ticonderoga</a>. Purely because I have a stash large enough to kindle and light my house on fire for years to come. Why buy more? Next, the ink for illustration. I tried a couple of pens for this but ultimately found comfort in <a href="https://www.sakuraofamerica.com/">Sakura Micron pens</a>, they come in a variety of widths and colors. Best of all, they don&rsquo;t bleed with watercolors. For the record, though, I do enjoy a <a href="https://www.muji.us/store/stationery/pen-pencils/capped-gel-ink.html">MUJI Gel Ink Ballpoint pen</a>. ðŸ‘Œ Finally, the paint. Though our art closet has many types to choose from, I personally like to go with watercolor paints. More vexingly specific: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Acid-Free-Non-Toxic-Watercolor-Assorted/dp/B00KPZCU30">General Pencil Kimberly Acid-Free Non-Toxic Water Soluble Watercolor Pencils</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/colors-SKEPY24-Sakura-Color-watercolor/dp/B001DUCZM2">Sakura Watercolor Pencils</a>. Both of which seem to be fine products. But, really, I&rsquo;m able to use pretty much anything that comes across my desk. The canvas comes in many forms but my personal preference is cold press 300-gram <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canson-Watercolor-Textured-Charcoal-7022446/dp/B0049UXGD0/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=watercolor+paper&amp;qid=1606243900&amp;sr=8-5">watercolor paper</a>.</p>
<p>As I started drawing and painting, I noticed that what my son was saying to me had some clout. I noticed my stress dissipate, I felt renewed/refreshed. These are the moments that I start to look studies up. I started reading about the benefits of a daily habit ritual â€” or, a hobby. I needed to affirm my feelings and found scientific evidence for the health benefits of drawing in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07421656.2016.1166832">study in 2016 at Drexel University</a> that found statistically significant lower levels of cortisol after 45 minutes of making art. The body typically releases cortisol, a hormone made in the adrenal gland, in response to danger, which is great if you are being chased by COVID.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://nyti.ms/35mlCxO">statement</a> given to <em>The New York Times</em> the author of the paper, Girija Kaimal said, â€œ&hellip; if you are constantly feeling stressed, which is perceived as a threat by your brain, your cortisol levels will consistently be high. If youâ€™re constantly on high alert, it puts a lot of pressure on your heart. It takes away resources from your digestive system. A series of chronic health conditions can develop if youâ€™re not able to feel relaxed and not able to regulate down the cortisol in your body.â€</p>
<p>For my health, that was enough for me to pick up the habit of art again. I plan to make it part of my daily journaling.</p>
