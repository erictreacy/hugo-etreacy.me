<p>Bob is the family cat. Or was. We had to put-him-down this last month due to organ failure. He was going on 17-years as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_cat">Himalayan</a>. I met him when he was about 5 years.
He was around for quite some time; you can do the math. We miss him. He now sits on our bookshelf in a little urn with this picture.</p>

<h3 id="reactjs--music">ReactJS &amp; Music</h3>
<p>Playing with ReactJS has been on my list of things to get to as-of-late. I have developed with it in the past but felt the need to dive back into it to keep my feet wet.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer I was given a post from a friend that I grew up with playing music. I was asked to make a daily post on Facebook showing the
top-10 rock bands that influenced my taste in music. Though my tastes have generated a greater spectrum over my professional/daily life, there are
10 albums that bring me the most joy when I think about them. I&rsquo;m not much for Facebook but I took the suggestion as a chance to make a project.
I decided to make a single page app using the popular <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app"><code>create-react-app</code></a>. Plus, it gave me a good reason to use one of my favorite fonts: <a href="https://djr.com/input/">Input Mono</a> by
<a href="https://djr.com/">David Jonathan Ross</a> (aka DJR).</p>
<p>The site can be seen <a href="https://music-fun-g36h7j3pd.now.sh/">here</a>. Iâ€™m still working on it as of this post. Aside from the posts, I created the site using create-react-app, plopped it in
GitHub and deployed it with <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>. Each of the albums are linked to Spotify.</p>
