<p>I will be voting for <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/">Elizabeth Warren</a> in the Democratic Primary election. My modest <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ew-homepage-launch-050919?refcode=web-donate-box">donations</a> will also be going to her campaign â€” and you should consider her for your choice in the Democratic Primary election, too.</p>

<p>My choice is one of <em>many</em> factors: Student-Debt Relief, Higher-Education Reform, Universal Child Care, Ultra-Millionaire Tax, Real Corporate Profits Tax, Affordable Housing, Protecting Public Lands, Decreasing Maternal Mortality Rates, Protecting Abortion Rights, Climate &amp; Environment, Immigration, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren">etc</a>.</p>
<p>I want to know someone is actually representing humans, not just Americans. The main issue of which I care: Environment. Next, Immigration. Next, the rest.</p>
<p>I decided to make this post because I feel I needed to make it concrete. Though the list above encapsulates many of the issues that I feel passionate about, most of them are lagniappe â€” but, for the betterment of humanity: environment and immigration are at the top of my list.</p>
<p>This is the primary â€” and anything can happen between now and the general election â€” I know that. With a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/14/us/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-president.html">record number of democratic candidates</a> in the running, I only hope, at this time, that Warren will be the primary choice.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--mono)">***</div>
<p>This also is a bit of a response to <a href="https://macwright.org/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren.html">Tom MacWright&rsquo;s post</a> about his decision to vote for Elizabeth Warren in the coming democratic primaries. Over the years, I have become excited to read his material which, in turn, has assisted in my professional growth. Thanks, Tom. âœŒï¸</p>
