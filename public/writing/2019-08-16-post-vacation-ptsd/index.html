<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but sometimes I feel off: a couple/few times a year. I don&rsquo;t feel bad, just off.
Cloudy headed and mentally imbalanced. Sometimes confused and trying to find the words. Out of curiosity,
I decided to write about it while I was experiencing it and see what I conclude.</p>
<p>My mind is nebulous, and I feel slightly achy. I am not sick â€” I have, and do, eat well â€” and responsibly. I don&rsquo;t have a temperature or any inflammation in my glands. It is a Thursday workday. I am excited for the weekend to spend it with my family and in-laws. The only thing I can think of, though, is that I just came back from a week of vacation (a few weeks ago) and all I have been doing at work is catching up on a week&rsquo;s worth of work. I&rsquo;m not complaining â€” honestly â€” this isn&rsquo;t a rant about work; I love my job. This is more of an exploration of what seems like emotional incontinence. I&rsquo;m just saying that it&rsquo;s been a little more than a stressful couple of weeks than usual. First world problem, but this is me trying to think-out the cause.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/644019">Cannabidiol</a> I had last night. ðŸ˜</p>
<p>Maybe it was that my family and I vacationed in <a href="https://www.nps.gov/glca/index.htm">Glen Canyon NP</a> a few weeks ago. We had some friends get married there. Though beautiful, there was something that concerned me: the environment. Low water levels, the haze, the commerce â€” the travel in general â€” the fact that we know:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324992370_The_carbon_footprint_of_global_tourism">Tourismâ€™s carbon footprint grew four times as much as expected from 2009 to 2013 and accounted for 8 percent of all greenhouse-gas emissions in that period.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273901806_Assessing_tourism's_global_environmental_impact_1900-2050">The travel industry is expected to consume 92 percent more water in 2050 than it did in 2010, and 189 percent more land.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21639159.2019.1577158?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;">People are less likely to recycle while on vacation (both because theyâ€™re unsure how to, and because getting away with things seems to be a key part of getting away from it all)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I can go on, but in a nutshell, the place was starting to look trampled on â€” used. Yes, they are expanding parking lots there in areas but, that&rsquo;s just it: expanding to accommodate more people than it already cannot support.</p>
<p>But, hey, in all sincerity, it was an amazing place with great experiences and people. It was a fun and rewarding trip. About 23.3333333% shameful. The rest, humanful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that bad feeling again&hellip; I need a break. <em>CBD consumption @ 40mg</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back. I took some time to organize some of my photos on <a href="//www.amazon.com/photos/shared/azjWTYJWRzWYfUdK_0zhCA.3WPkmnXaDMaR-tzEXvZ6cn">Amazon Photos</a>.</p>
<p>Then to affirm my emotions about my travels, I decided to take a <a href="//www.atmosfair.de/en/offset/flight">carbon footprint test</a> to see how much CO2 emissions my family put off while making our travels. Because according to a New York Times article by the excellent Andy Newman, our trips can be calculated by an online carbon calculator. Basically, in short,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>32 sq. ft. is the amount of Arctic summer sea ice cover that one passengerâ€™s share of emissions melts on a 2,500-mile flight.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a confusing statement. That means that for each 2,500-miles traveled, 32 sq.ft. of Arctic summer sea ice melts. I don&rsquo;t even need to do the calculation â€” I know it&rsquo;s not good given that we drove from Marquette, MI to Minneapolis, MN and then flew to Phonix, AZ only to travel more to Glen Canyon NP â€” and then back. Hmph.</p>
<p>To tangent a bit, I have been reading the <a href="https://www.newphilosopher.com/product/issue-24-balance/">New Philosopher &lsquo;Balance&rsquo; issue</a> this week and I have come to a few ideas as to why I may feel off. Sometimes â€” aside from the potential for nutrient imbalance or weather conditions in Marquette, Michigan on June 13, 2019 â€” I feel as though I have been trying to keep myself in balance more since having children. I have been trying to play a role and stay on it at any given cost. It mentally drains me and though I sleep (though only about 4-5 hrs a night), I still feel like I am playing catchup. To add to the stress, I listened to <a href="https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/professor">Matt Walker</a> in a TED talk about sleep during our travels home. I&rsquo;ll save you the words: it concerns me greatly.</p>
<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/matt_walker_sleep_is_your_superpower" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
I have been thinking & studying about sleep lately. And then, Glen Canyon NP, again. I think it was the site of Glen Canyon NP that is putting the emotional hangover on my mind and, in turn, my body.
<p>Conclusion: I&rsquo;m tired today from my post-traumatic stressing-out about my recent family vacation travels.</p>
<p>Or, the in-laws&hellip;? Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to be stressed-out about in-laws? Rarely, am I stressed about them. I love them and they are amazing people. So, no, it&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>I need to get back to work. It&rsquo;s good for me.</p>
