description: The blog, projects, and internet propensity of Eric Treacy.
---

Eric is a engineer with an affinity and aptitude for bench science, lab design and software.

Most of my days are spent in the lab making products for my community, but
I occasionally take respite to create [web ephemera](/projects/) involving code and minimal design through various web technologies.

I enjoy taking [photos](/photos/), [reading](/reading/), [music](https://bandcamp.com/etreacy), writing [code](https://github.com/erictreacy), playing [outdoors](https://www.alltrails.com/members/eric-treacy)
and [writing](/writing/) about the anxieties over our technological evolution.

Let's chat! Feel free to [contact](/about/) me at anytime.
