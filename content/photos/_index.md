description: A collection of landscape and outdoor photography from my travels and adventures
---

I enjoy capturing moments through photography, particularly landscapes and outdoor scenes. This collection spans various locations, from the rugged trails of Colorado to the coastal views of California. Each photo represents a moment of exploration and discovery, often taken during hikes, climbs, or travels with family and/or friends.

Most of these photos were captured with whatever camera I had on handâ€”usually my trusty iPhone 5s, though occasionally my Nikon D5000 made an appearance. They serve as visual bookmarks of places I've been and experiences I've shared.
