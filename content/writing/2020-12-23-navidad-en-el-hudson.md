That gray sponge!<br>
That sailor whose throat was just cut.<br>
That great river.<br>
Those dark boundaries of the breeze.<br>
That keen blade, my love, that keen blade.<br>
The four sailors wrestled with the world.<br>
With that sharp-edged world that all eyes see.<br>
With the world no one can know without horses.<br>
One, a hundred, a thousand sailors<br>
wrestling with the world of keen-edged velocities,<br>
unaware that the world<br>
was alone in the sky.
<br>

The world alone in the lonely sky.<br>
Hills of hammers and the thick grass's triumph.<br>
Teeming anthills and coins in the mire.<br>
The world alone in the lonely sky,<br>
and the air where all the villages end.
<br>


The earthworm sand its terror of the wheel,<br>
and the sailor whose throat was slashed<br>
sang to the water-bear that held him close;<br>
and they were all singing alleluia,<br>
alleluia. Deserted sky.<br>
It's all the same â€” the same! â€” alleluia.
<br>

I stood all night on the scaffolding in the boroughs,<br>
leaving my blood on the stucco projects,<br>
helping the sailors lower their ripped sails,<br>
and I stand with empty ands in the murmur of the river's mouth.<br>
It doesn't matter if every minute<br>
a newborn child waves the little branches of its veins,<br>
of if a newborn viper, set free beneath the branches,<br>
calms the blood lust of those who looks at the nude.<br>
What matter is this: emptied space. Lonely world. River's mouth.<br>
Not dawn. Idle fable.<br>
This alone: river's mouth.<br>
Oh, my gray sponge!<br>
Oh, my throat just cut open!<br>
Oh, my great river!<br>
Oh, my breeze's boundaries that are not mine!<br>
Oh, the keep blade of my love, oh, the cutting blade!<br>
