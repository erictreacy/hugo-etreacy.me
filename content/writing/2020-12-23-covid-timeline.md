Over this past year I have taken the time to catalog all of the most important information gained through this last year concerning the Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. I have come to the conclusion that at no point in scientific history has there been a time where the whole world came together and pooled every bit of data that was know about something to rid it from the planet. In an interview with the renowned Immunologist, [Pippa Marrack](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1204-1270),  she described the work of the science community much like that of the [Eye of Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron).

Obviously there is much more data out there that can be found and you can read that on [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00502-w) where they wade through the literature on the new coronavirus â€” and summarizes key papers as they appear. This timeline is my compilation of information read via [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus), [*Science Magazine*](https://www.sciencemag.org/collections/coronavirus?intcmp=ghd_cov) and [*Nature Publications*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00502-w), et al.
