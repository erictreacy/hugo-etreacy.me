I like to think that I will be trying my best to make a â€˜latelyâ€™ post at least once every 1-2 months, depending on my life obligations. But keeping a log of my recent
doings has been on my list of things I want to do. Such as listening to music and working with new software...life, in general. Maybe I might even talk a little
about working with new chemicals in the lab. At any rate, I will attempt to log. These posts will not be very well prepared, just jots.

### Music while bike touring

I have been going to concerts since I was in elementary school. One of my early concerts was [R.E.M.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M.) at [The Palace of Auburn Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palace_of_Auburn_Hills) near Detroit
when they were on their [Monster tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(R.E.M._album)). I have been a loving fan of R.E.M. since I can remember. That concert is one of the most memorable times of my life.

During my long bike tours, lately, I have found myself revisiting them â€” along with Aaron Dessner (The National) and Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) â€” both of which
are also obsessions of mine, but recently they have all joined and made my most current Ã¼ber obsession.

I have always longed for Michael Stipe's voice. It has always provided comfort for me. Now with Big Red Machine
in force, I am above the clouds (that is supposed to be a good thing). Iâ€™m listening to them now as I write this.

### The dot com switch

I have been working with my old domain https://etreacy.me for several years now and decided to change to .com. I have also
changed my hosting and overhauled my entire site to run in A.W.S. I am currently using A.W.S. Cloud9 for editing, S3 for storage/hosting, and Route 53 domain
registry, and CloudFront for C.D.N. Whereas before, .me was working with GitHub and Netlifyâ€™s DNS/CDN network with DreamHost domain
registry. I was driven to make my site more efficient and hosted â€˜greenâ€™, whatever that may mean these days. But for me, I host my website in
Amazonâ€™s A.W.S. Central server (Montreal, Canada), which the energy to run is used with â€˜sustainable/renewableâ€™ energy via hydroelectric dams. Also, I wanted my site to run at no
data-cost (or at least very little) to the viewer. Both domains still exist, and I plan to make the .me domain forward to .com, because according to [Apex Ping](https://ping.apex.sh/), this switch yields
a mean response time of 60 ms, which as before it was ~140 ms. That generates a 40% improvement response time, switching from Netlify to CloudFront.

Iâ€™m still working on optimizing my images, though. That can take some timeâ€”more about optimizing this site later.
