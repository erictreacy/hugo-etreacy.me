Bob is the family cat. Or was. We had to put-him-down this last month due to organ failure. He was going on 17-years as a [Himalayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_cat). I met him when he was about 5 years.
He was around for quite some time; you can do the math. We miss him. He now sits on our bookshelf in a little urn with this picture.

### ReactJS & Music

Playing with ReactJS has been on my list of things to get to as-of-late. I have developed with it in the past but felt the need to dive back into it to keep my feet wet.

Earlier this summer I was given a post from a friend that I grew up with playing music. I was asked to make a daily post on Facebook showing the
top-10 rock bands that influenced my taste in music. Though my tastes have generated a greater spectrum over my professional/daily life, there are
10 albums that bring me the most joy when I think about them. I'm not much for Facebook but I took the suggestion as a chance to make a project.
I decided to make a single page app using the popular [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Plus, it gave me a good reason to use one of my favorite fonts: [Input Mono](https://djr.com/input/) by
[David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com/) (aka DJR).

The site can be seen [here](https://music-fun-g36h7j3pd.now.sh/). Iâ€™m still working on it as of this post. Aside from the posts, I created the site using create-react-app, plopped it in
GitHub and deployed it with [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Each of the albums are linked to Spotify.
