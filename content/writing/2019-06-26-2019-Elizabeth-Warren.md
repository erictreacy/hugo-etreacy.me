I will be voting for [Elizabeth Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/) in the Democratic Primary election. My modest [donations](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ew-homepage-launch-050919?refcode=web-donate-box) will also be going to her campaign â€” and you should consider her for your choice in the Democratic Primary election, too.

My choice is one of *many* factors: Student-Debt Relief, Higher-Education Reform, Universal Child Care, Ultra-Millionaire Tax, Real Corporate Profits Tax, Affordable Housing, Protecting Public Lands, Decreasing Maternal Mortality Rates, Protecting Abortion Rights, Climate & Environment, Immigration, [etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren).

I want to know someone is actually representing humans, not just Americans. The main issue of which I care: Environment. Next, Immigration. Next, the rest.

I decided to make this post because I feel I needed to make it concrete. Though the list above encapsulates many of the issues that I feel passionate about, most of them are lagniappe â€” but, for the betterment of humanity: environment and immigration are at the top of my list.

This is the primary â€” and anything can happen between now and the general election â€” I know that. With a [record number of democratic candidates](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/14/us/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-president.html) in the running, I only hope, at this time, that Warren will be the primary choice.

This also is a bit of a response to [Tom MacWright's post](https://macwright.org/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren.html) about his decision to vote for Elizabeth Warren in the coming democratic primaries. Over the years, I have become excited to read his material which, in turn, has assisted in my professional growth. Thanks, Tom. âœŒï¸
