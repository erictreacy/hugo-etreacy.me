It doesn't happen often, but sometimes I feel off: a couple/few times a year. I don't feel bad, just off.
Cloudy headed and mentally imbalanced. Sometimes confused and trying to find the words. Out of curiosity,
I decided to write about it while I was experiencing it and see what I conclude.

My mind is nebulous, and I feel slightly achy. I am not sick â€” I have, and do, eat well â€” and responsibly. I don't have a temperature or any inflammation in my glands. It is a Thursday workday. I am excited for the weekend to spend it with my family and in-laws. The only thing I can think of, though, is that I just came back from a week of vacation (a few weeks ago) and all I have been doing at work is catching up on a week's worth of work. I'm not complaining â€” honestly â€” this isn't a rant about work; I love my job. This is more of an exploration of what seems like emotional incontinence. I'm just saying that it's been a little more than a stressful couple of weeks than usual. First world problem, but this is me trying to think-out the cause.

Maybe it was the [Cannabidiol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/644019) I had last night. ðŸ˜

Maybe it was that my family and I vacationed in [Glen Canyon NP](https://www.nps.gov/glca/index.htm) a few weeks ago. We had some friends get married there. Though beautiful, there was something that concerned me: the environment. Low water levels, the haze, the commerce â€” the travel in general â€” the fact that we know:

- [Tourismâ€™s carbon footprint grew four times as much as expected from 2009 to 2013 and accounted for 8 percent of all greenhouse-gas emissions in that period.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324992370_The_carbon_footprint_of_global_tourism)
- [The travel industry is expected to consume 92 percent more water in 2050 than it did in 2010, and 189 percent more land.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273901806_Assessing_tourism's_global_environmental_impact_1900-2050)
- [People are less likely to recycle while on vacation (both because theyâ€™re unsure how to, and because getting away with things seems to be a key part of getting away from it all)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21639159.2019.1577158?scroll=top&needAccess=true&)

I can go on, but in a nutshell, the place was starting to look trampled on â€” used. Yes, they are expanding parking lots there in areas but, that's just it: expanding to accommodate more people than it already cannot support.

But, hey, in all sincerity, it was an amazing place with great experiences and people. It was a fun and rewarding trip. About 23.3333333% shameful. The rest, humanful.

There's that bad feeling again... I need a break. *CBD consumption @ 40mg*

I'm back. I took some time to organize some of my photos on [Amazon Photos](//www.amazon.com/photos/shared/azjWTYJWRzWYfUdK_0zhCA.3WPkmnXaDMaR-tzEXvZ6cn).

Then to affirm my emotions about my travels, I decided to take a [carbon footprint test](//www.atmosfair.de/en/offset/flight) to see how much CO2 emissions my family put off while making our travels. Because according to a New York Times article by the excellent Andy Newman, our trips can be calculated by an online carbon calculator. Basically, in short,

> *32 sq. ft. is the amount of Arctic summer sea ice cover that one passengerâ€™s share of emissions melts on a 2,500-mile flight.*

That is a confusing statement. That means that for each 2,500-miles traveled, 32 sq.ft. of Arctic summer sea ice melts. I don't even need to do the calculation â€” I know it's not good given that we drove from Marquette, MI to Minneapolis, MN and then flew to Phonix, AZ only to travel more to Glen Canyon NP â€” and then back. Hmph.

To tangent a bit, I have been reading the [New Philosopher 'Balance' issue](https://www.newphilosopher.com/product/issue-24-balance/) this week and I have come to a few ideas as to why I may feel off. Sometimes â€” aside from the potential for nutrient imbalance or weather conditions in Marquette, Michigan on June 13, 2019 â€” I feel as though I have been trying to keep myself in balance more since having children. I have been trying to play a role and stay on it at any given cost. It mentally drains me and though I sleep (though only about 4-5 hrs a night), I still feel like I am playing catchup. To add to the stress, I listened to [Matt Walker](https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/professor) in a TED talk about sleep during our travels home. I'll save you the words: it concerns me greatly.

I have been thinking & studying about sleep lately. And then, Glen Canyon NP, again. I think it was the site of Glen Canyon NP that is putting the emotional hangover on my mind and, in turn, my body.


Conclusion: I'm tired today from my post-traumatic stressing-out about my recent family vacation travels.

Or, the in-laws...? Aren't we supposed to be stressed-out about in-laws? Rarely, am I stressed about them. I love them and they are amazing people. So, no, it's not that.

I need to get back to work. It's good for me.
