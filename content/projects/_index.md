**Global Government Health Expenditures** <br>
The [project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/erictreacy/country-gov-t-public-healthcare) focuses on collecting, cleaning, and analyzing public health expenditure data from various countries to uncover trends and insights. By leveraging Python for data preprocessing and SQL for database querying, it creates a robust and interactive dataset that provides policymakers, researchers, and the public with valuable insights into how nations allocate resources to healthcare.
