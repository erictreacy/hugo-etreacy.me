# ⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

This `resources/` directory contains automatically generated cache and processed assets from Hugo. Any changes made here will be overwritten when Hugo processes your assets.

Instead, modify the source files in:
- `assets/` for CSS, JavaScript, and other source assets
- `static/` for files that should be copied directly to the site

These files are automatically generated and managed by Hugo's asset pipeline.
